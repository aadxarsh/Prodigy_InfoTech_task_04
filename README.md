* Key Steps:Loaded dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
            Preprocessed features (encoded categorical values, handled imbalance)
            Split data into training and test sets
            Built a DecisionTreeClassifier using sklearn
            Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

* Tools/Libraries:
Python, Pandas, jupyter notebook, vs code, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

* conclusion: After analyzing thousands of tweets, I’ve learned one thing:
                                                                         Twitter is 20% facts, 80% feelings, and 100% drama.
